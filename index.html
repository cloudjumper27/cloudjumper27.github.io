	<h1>Hi there, I'm Kamahl Pinto!</h1>
	<h2>My Bio<h2>
	<p>Greetings my name is Kamahl Pinto I am a computer science major and as of this letter soon to be a graduate from Medgar Evers college. I like the technology field a lot it started with games and the latest gadgets. I spent a lot of time with these things which in turn lead to my curiosity of how they work and what it takes to make them work. I also like watching various forms of movies and anime which I really love I always try to find the next interesting and engaging one to watch after I’m done with the last. I am also big on music I always try to listen to different types of music from around the world I think it’s great to have so many different types of songs out there that you can feel even if you don’t understand the lyrics half the time lol.
